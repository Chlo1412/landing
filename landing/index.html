   <h2>About us</h2>
   <p>
   	Music &  Soul is a musical school which allows new artists to develop their talents. We are well-known for our numerous events and our teachers. Each month, we organize a show and an audition which represents our artists and we will also be searching new talents via the audition. It is now your chance to share what you can do, whether, it's singing, beatmaking, producing or playing any insttrument. 
   	It is maybe the perfect time to shoot your shot!
